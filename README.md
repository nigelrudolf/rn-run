# rn-run

## Description: 

React Native Development Automation Tool for MacOS
rn-run is a command-line utility written in Rust that streamlines React Native development by automating the entire app launch process for both iOS and Android platforms.

What It Does
rn-run is a "one-command solution" for React Native developers that eliminates the tedious manual steps typically required to run React Native apps. Instead of manually:

* Stopping existing Metro bundler processes
* Closing simulators
* Managing terminal windows
* Installing dependencies
* Starting the packager
* Launching the simulator/emulator

You simply run `rn-run --ios` or `rn-run --android` and the tool handles everything automatically.

## Usage: 
```
rn-run [OPTIONS]
```

## Options:
```
  -i, --ios                    Run iOS
  -a, --android                Run Android
  -s, --simulator <SIMULATOR>  
  -c, --clean-install          Clean install
  -h, --help                   Print help
  -V, --version                Print version
```

## Setup

On MacOS you will need to set **Ask before closing** to **Never** in Terminal settings
